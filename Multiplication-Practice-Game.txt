Write a Python program that helps users practice multiplication.

The program should allow the user to:

1) Generate a random multiplication question (e.g., 7 Ã— 8)

2) Let the user enter an answer

3) Tell the user if the answer is correct or not

4) Keep track of how many correct answers the user gives

5) Exit the program when the user chooses

Make sure the program uses functions and is easy to read.
