# Programming Exercise: Olympic Medals Data Analysis

Write a Python program to analyze data from a CSV file named `olympic_medals.csv`. 
This file contains information about Olympic athletes, including their Name, Age, Country, and number of Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals.

---

## Your program should:

1. **Load the data:**  
   - Read the CSV file, assuming well-formed data (no commas inside quoted fields).  

2. **Implement functions to:**  
   - Calculate the total number of medals won by a specified country.  
   - Compute the average age of athletes from a given country.  
   - Identify the athlete with the most total medals from a country.  
   - Determine which country has won the most gold medals overall.
   - List all distinct sports represented in the dataset.
   - Find the top athlete (most total medals) in a specific sport.
   - Identify the athlete with the most gold medals in a given sport.

3. **Provide a user menu that allows:**  
   - Selecting one of the above queries by entering a choice.  
   - Inputting the required country name when needed.  
   - Viewing the list of all sports available in the dataset.
   - Exiting the program gracefully.

## Requirements:

- Use appropriate data structures (lists, dictionaries) to store and process the data.  
- Handle user inputs cleanly and validate where necessary.  
- Write modular code with clear functions for each task.

---

## Bonus (optional):

- Add a feature to display the total number of athletes from a given country.  
- Add a filter to list athletes above a certain age.

---

## Deliverable:

Submit a complete Python script that meets the above requirements and runs interactively via the console.
