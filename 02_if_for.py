# Check if a number is a Spy Number (A number is called a Spy number if the sum of its digits is equal to the product of its digits.)
# For example, 1124 is a Spy number because 1+1+2+4=8 and 1∗1∗2∗4=8.

# Check if a number is a Disarium Number:
# A number is called a Disarium number if the sum of its digits raised to their respective positions is equal to the number itself.
# For example, 135 is a Disarium number because  1^1 + 3^2 + 5 ^3 = 134
