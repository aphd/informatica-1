Write a Python program that helps the user practice prime number identification.

The program should:

1) Randomly generate a number between 1 and 100.

2) Ask the user if the number is prime (Yes/No).

3) Check the user's answer and provide feedback.

4) Keep track of how many questions the user got right.

5) Exit when the user chooses.

Use functions for clarity and organization.
